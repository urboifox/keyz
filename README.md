# Keyz

Keyz is a cross platform key strokes visualizer built with rust (tauri).
this is a beta release, if you find any problems while using the app, please open a PR.

## Why Keyz

The app is inspired from macos key visualizers apps, like Keycastr. I wanted to have something similar for my ubuntu to record my videos. but sadly there weren't. So I created this.

I hope it will be useful for other people too.


## Features

- it currently supports all the main keys like: numbers, letters, ctrl, etc..
- always on top so you don't have to worry about putting it beside your apps, it will just stick on top.
- I hope i will add more features in the future. You can suggest some!

## Support

Currently it's available for `linux` and `windows`.
for macos I'm sure something like keycastr and other mac alternatives is enough.
this app is meant for linux, windows
